Problem 1.
Consider the following two charges:
Q1 = 1 nC is at x = 0 cm and y = 0 cm
Q2 = -1 nC is at x = 0 cm and y = 1 cm
(a) MATLAB: plot the charges at appropriate locations, with figure axes labeled
(b) MATLAB: determine the electric forces on charges and display them on plot (b) using quiver
function. Display values of x and y components of the forces on the command line.
(c) MATLAB: define a grid for computing E-field vectors, using meshgrid command, with grid size =
0.2 cm. Arrange the grid such that grid points immediately next to a charge are equidistant from
that charge. Plot this grid on plot from (c).
(d) MATLAB: plot the electric field using quiver function, at all grid points. You should end up with
two figures, one with grid, and one with E-field vectors.
(e) Calculate the electric field at point x = 2 cm, y = 1 cm.
Problem 2.
Uniform straight line charge of finite length (l = 1 cm, Q = 1 nC) is placed such that the center of the line
is at x = 0 cm, y = 0 cm and the line is in the direction of y-axis.
(a) Calculate (analytically) the electric field at x = 0.5 cm and y = 0.5 cm [Hint: see textbook Example
1.8]
(b) MATLAB: Calculate the electric field at the same coordinates numerically by breaking the line
into 100 segments dl. Compare result to (a).
